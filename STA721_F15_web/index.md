### Description

This course introduces students to Gaussian linear models and
extensions for model building, including exploratory data analysis
techniques, variable transformations and selection, parameter
estimation and interpretation, prediction, hierarchical models, model
selection and Bayesian model averaging. The concepts of linear models
will be covered from Bayesian and classical viewpoints. Topics in
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation will be introduced as required,
however it is expected that students have either taken STA 601 or are
co-registed.

All students should be extremely comfortable with linear/matrix algebra and
mathematical statistics at the level of STA 611 (Statistical Inference
- Casella and Berger is an excellent resource).  If you need to
review linear algebra, please explore resources under [Links](/links)

* Computer: You should have access to a laptop or desktop capable of
  running [R or RStudio](/resources).  We will use R as a programming language
  at later stages for data analysis and use existing packages written
  in R to support the course.  See the [Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources) page
  for books and other reseources for learning R.

* Calculator: You should bring a calculator to exams. There is no
  restrictions on the type of calculator (but not on a mobile device)

### Discussion Forums

We will be using
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/duke/fall2015/sta72101f15/home) for class
discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and
efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing
questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your
questions on Piazza (peer answers earn participation points!). If you
have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
team@piazza.com.

Find our class page at: [Piazza](https://piazza.com/duke/fall2015/sta72101f15/home)  or through the link on Sakai

![DukeGreenClassroomCertification](images/DukeGreenClassroomCertification-Logo.png)

This course has achieved Duke’s Green Classroom Certification. The certification indicates that the faculty member teaching this course has taken significant steps to green the delivery of this course. Your faculty member has completed a checklist indicating their common practices in areas of this course that have an environmental impact, such as paper and energy consumption. Some common practices implemented by faculty to reduce the environmental impact of their course include allowing electronic submission of assignments, providing online readings and turning off lights and electronics in the classroom when they are not in use. The eco-friendly aspects of course delivery may vary by faculty, by course and throughout the semester.
