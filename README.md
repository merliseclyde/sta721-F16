===========

Course materials for STA 721 - Fall 2016 semester at Duke University.

Course website is at https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall16/sta721/.


This web design is cloned and modifed from Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's
material for STA 101 at
https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/sta101_sp15 using the noita theme.


The directory STA721_F16_web contains code for the website that is
compiled using jekyll.  The colors are changed in the file
STA721_F16_web/noita/foundation/foundation.min.css
(use firebug to see colors and then edit file to add new ones;
colorpicker is a goog way to find the HEX for colors)

The other directories include materials for lectures (LaTeX, R, data)
